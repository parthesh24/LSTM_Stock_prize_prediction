# Google Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This repository contains an implementation of an LSTM model to predict Google's stock price. The model is built using Python and Keras.

#Experimentation
In this project, various hyperparameters such as the split ratio, time stamp value, number of LSTM layers, and number of neurons in LSTM layers were experimented with. Below are the details:

Split Ratio: Training and test data were split with an 80-20 ratio.
Time Stamp: Time step values such as 50, 100, and 150 were tested.
LSTM Layers: Models with 1, 2, and 3 LSTM layers were tested.
Neurons: Different numbers of neurons (50, 100, 150) in the LSTM layers were tested.
#Results
The results of the model are visualized in the form of plots showing the actual and predicted stock prices. Further tuning and optimization can be performed to improve the model's accuracy.
